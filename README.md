# WeatherSandApp

## Idea & Description

Have you ever had to open 2-3 applications to check the weather and mentally estimate the approximate temperature and the probability of precipitation?

Well, I really hope so, because this app will help you to know the average weather forecast values from different sources. You can find your city, see it's forecast for a week, save it locally and/or use your geoposition for check the weather.

At the moment it's a very first version of the app(a little crude). But stay tuned! The work doesn't stop.
